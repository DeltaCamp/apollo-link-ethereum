# Apollo Web3 Link

The `apollo-link-web3` package allows you to use GraphQL to speak directly to a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

The package integrates with [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com) as a "link".  It is organized into separate packages to allow for different client bindings (i.e. web3js, ethers.js, ethjs)

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [apollo-link-web3](./packages/apollo-link-web3/README.md) | The main package |
| [apollo-link-web3-resolver-web3js](./packages/apollo-link-web3-resolver-web3js) | A package that provides a Web3js 1.0 binding |
